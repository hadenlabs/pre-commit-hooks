# How to use this project
usage: |-

  Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks.
  Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.


  ```yaml
    repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks
        rev: 0.4.0
        hooks:
          - id: terraform-fmt
          - id: terraform-validate
          - id: markdown-link-check
          - id: go-fmt

  ```

  Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks.
  That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.
