 This repository is a collection of Git hooks to be used with the
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework. 




## Features

## TODO


* [chore: implement hook gnu make](https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks/issues/2)







## Installation
### Base

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). E.g. `brew install pre-commit`
### MacOS

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint), [Go](https://golang.org/), [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck). E.g

```shell script
  brew install terraform \
      tflint \
      go \
      golangci/tap/golangci-lint \
      shellcheck && \
      yarn global add markdown-link-check
```
### Linux




## Usage


Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks.
Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.


```yaml
  repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: 0.3.0
      hooks:
        - id: terraform-fmt
        - id: terraform-validate
        - id: markdown-link-check
        - id: go-fmt

```

Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks.
That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:

1. Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
1. Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
1. Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is
  increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is
  increased. (Pre-release)
