This repository is a collection of Git hooks to be used with the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

## Features

- [Terraform](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
- [Markdown](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check)
- [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)

## To-do

- [chore: implement hook gnu make](https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks/issues/2)

- [chore: implement hook Go](https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks/issues/3)

## Installation

### Base

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). E.g. `brew install pre-commit`

### MacOS

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint), [Go](https://golang.org/), [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck). E.g

```shell script
  brew install terraform \
      tflint \
      go \
      golangci/tap/golangci-lint \
      shellcheck && \
      yarn global add markdown-link-check
```

### Linux

## Usage

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks. Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: <VERSION> # Check for the latest version: https://github.com/mineiros-io/pre-commit-hooks/releases
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
      - id: tflint
      - id: markdown-link-check
```

Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks. That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.

## Examples

### Example: Run All Hooks

```shell script
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Example: Run A Specific Hook

```shell script
pre-commit run terraform-validate --all-files
```
