This repository is a collection of Git hooks to be used with the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.

## Features

- [Terraform](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
- [TodoCheck](https://github.com/preslavmihaylov/todocheck)
- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Markdown](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check)
- [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
- [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

## To-do

- [chore: implement hook gnu make](https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks/issues/2)

## Installation

### Base

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). E.g. `brew install pre-commit`

### MacOS

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint), [Go](https://golang.org/), [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck). E.g

```shell script
  brew install terraform \
      tflint \
      go \
      golangci/tap/golangci-lint \
      shellcheck && \
      yarn global add markdown-link-check
```

### Linux

## Usage

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` inside your repositories and add the desired list of hooks. Please see the [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) for further information.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/hadenlabs/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: 0.2.0
    hooks:
      - id: terraform-fmt
      - id: terraform-validate
      - id: markdown-link-check
      - id: go-fmt
```

Once you created the configuration file inside your repository, you must run `pre-commit install` to activate the hooks. That's it, pre-commit will now listen for changes in your files and run the checks accordingly.

## Examples

### Example: Run All Hooks

```shell script
pre-commit run --all-files

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).

Using the given version number of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we apply the following constructs:

1. Use the `MAJOR` version for incompatible changes.
1. Use the `MINOR` version when adding functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
1. Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
